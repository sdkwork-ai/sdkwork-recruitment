  "errorRecovery": true,
  "theme": "system",
  "featureRegistry": true
}

- No explicit permission scope selected. Inherit the component module catalog.

## Integration Rules

- Consume the generated app SDK package for the architecture language.
- Never copy sdkwork-appbase routes, DTOs, or generated transport into this application.
- Keep credentials in the global token manager / host adapter, never in component config.
- Change component settings through `config/components/appbase.json`, not by editing generated code.

See `../sdkwork-specs/APP_SDK_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md`.
