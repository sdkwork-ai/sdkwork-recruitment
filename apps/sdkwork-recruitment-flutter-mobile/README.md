## Structure

```text
apps/sdkwork-recruitment-flutter-mobile/
  lib/
    main.dart
    app.dart
    theme/
      app_theme.dart
    auth/social/
      social_provider.dart
      social_auth_service.dart
      social_auth_launcher.dart
      social_login_config.dart
      iam_social_auth_service.dart
      social_auth_factory.dart
      social_login_panel.dart
    composition/
      architecture_registry.dart
      component_registry.dart
  test/
  config/components/
  specs/component.spec.json
  pubspec.yaml
```

`lib/` stays thin: app entry, root shell, component registry, and bootstrap wiring. The shell uses a Material 3 bottom `NavigationBar` with `Overview / Surfaces / Components / Me`. Feature screens belong in `packages/sdkwork_recruitment_flutter_mobile-<capability>/`.

## Social Sign-In

`lib/auth/social/` is a provider-agnostic port/adapter module:

- `SocialAuthService` and `SocialAuthLauncher` are interfaces; the panel depends on them, not on IAM.
- `IamSocialAuthService` calls `oauth.providersList` and `oauth.authorizationUrlsCreate`.
- Provider descriptors and IAM aliases live in one catalog; there is no provider switch in the UI.
- `social_login_config.dart` is generated from `config/components/iam.json`.
- `specs/capabilities/social-login.contract.json` records the backend authority and frontend allowlist.

Configure `SDKWORK_API_BASE_URL` with `--dart-define` to enable the panel. Provider
secrets and callback exchange stay in `sdkwork-iam`; the app only opens the
authorization URL.

## Commands

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

Generated Dart/Flutter SDK dependencies are appended to `pubspec.yaml` from the selected component registry.

## Boundaries

- Do not import React or native platform UI packages.
- Do not construct SDK clients inside feature widgets; inject them from `lib/composition/` or the core package.
- Keep platform plugins behind typed host adapters.
- Generated SDK output is not edited by hand.
